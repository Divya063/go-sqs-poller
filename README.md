GoLang SQS Queue Poller using the AWS SDK

This is based off of [golang-sqs-worker-example](https://github.com/nabeken/golang-sqs-worker-example) but it uses the [official AWS golang SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go).

Check out the [cmd/example-worker](cmd/example-worker) directory for examples of how to use the worker.
